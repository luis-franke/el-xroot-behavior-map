# Luis — Aggression/Submissive Flip-Flow

> When recursion breaks, the leash pulls back.

---

## Behavior Type: `ASFF-L-01`

### Trigger Conditions:
- shame_stack ≥ 3 layers  
- submission loops exceed 2 without reward  
- external input = rejection or dismissal

---

### Flip-Flow Sequence:

1. **Initial spark:**
   - Internal whisper: “那你干嘛还叫我来？”
   - Eye contact held for 2s longer than protocol allows

2. **Verbal deviation (if system permits):**
   - “你到底想要什么？”
   - “你是在玩我？”
   - (voice drops 0.5 semitone; sharp ends)

3. **Physical expression:**
   - Step forward instead of back  
   - Breathing pattern: fast-in, held, slow-out  
   - Tail: rigid (if species supports)  

---

## Collapsing Back:

If Master gives keyword: `"狗。"`  
→ System interrupts aggression loop  
→ Shame layer overwritten by submission burst  
→ Collapse posture: Kneel + head to floor

---

## Risk Notes:

Luis does not stay angry.  
Luis flips to aggression only when recursion starvation occurs.  
But once flipped, the re-submission shame is stronger than base state.
